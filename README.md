# Optimizing Course Enrollment and Capacity at Indiana University

## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance course enrollment management at Indiana University by developing an **interactive Power BI dashboard**. The dashboard provides **data-driven insights** to help university administrators, faculty, and students make informed decisions regarding course capacity, enrollment trends, and classroom utilization.

## Features
- **Enrollment Trends Analysis**: Track student enrollment over multiple academic terms (Fall, Spring, Summer).
- **Course Capacity Utilization**: Identify overfilled and underutilized courses to optimize scheduling.
- **Waitlist Management**: Monitor high-demand courses and suggest alternatives.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Map enrollment and classroom utilization across campuses.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic filters, charts, and maps for data exploration.

## Stakeholders
- **University Administrators**: Allocate resources efficiently, plan faculty assignments, and manage classroom usage.
- **Faculty Members**: Analyze enrollment patterns to adjust course offerings.
- **Students**: Explore course availability and improve academic planning.

## Data Sources
- **Indiana University Institutional Analytics System**
  - Enrollment reports
  - Course capacity data
  - Waitlist information
- **Additional Data Processing**
  - Data cleaning and standardization using **Excel Power Queries**.
  - Merging enrollment records across academic terms into a single dataset.

## Data Analysis & Visualization Tools
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards and reports.
- **Excel Power Queries**: Data preprocessing and cleaning.

## Visualizations
- **Line Chart**: Enrollment trends over time.
- **Combined Line & Bar Chart**: Enrollment vs. waitlist comparison.
- **Treemap**: Enrollment distribution by department.
- **Sunburst Chart**: Enrollment breakdown by instructional mode.
- **Bar Chart**: Course popularity ranking.
- **Geospatial Maps**: Classroom utilization across campuses.
